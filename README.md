## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About Me

* I love BMX racing, RC cars/planes, and camping 
* Currenlty studying Computer Engineering at the University at Buffalo
* I am relatively new to GitHub, having only used it for academic projects so far!

How to reach me

* For now, please contact me via my university email *nwlasher@buffalo.edu*

Note that not all of these are publically visible for Academic Integrity Concerns---

Previous Projects:
* PONG on the Tiva C-series Launchpad, done entirely in ARM asm (help)
* Implementations of malloc, calloc, and realloc from undergrad assignments
* Libraries of working project artifacts to come soon.

I'm Currently working on multiple projects:
* CSE 450/453 Hardware/Software Integration - An instrumented projectile for the mobile pnuematic projectile motion platform (cannon) to track flight time
* EE 478 VHDL - Re-implementing PONG on an FPGA (previously done in ARM asm)
* Motion-controlled 2048 on an LED Matrix (UB Hacking 2025)
* More to Come!
